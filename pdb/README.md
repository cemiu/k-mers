# PDB Folder

This folder should contain compressed PDB files in the following format:

(dividing not required, can be in the same directry)
```
pdb/a0/1a00.ent.gz
pdb/a0/1a01.ent.gz
...
```

These can be downloaded downloaded from the official hosts / mirrors for PDB:

Official website describing how to download:
https://www.rcsb.org/docs/programmatic-access/file-download-services

Main mirror:
https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/pdb/

Other mirrors:
https://www.wwpdb.org/ftp/pdb-ftp-sites

Alternatively, a tarball of all pdbs (as of 2023-07-28) is hosted on https://pycom.brunel.ac.uk/misc/pdb_2023-07-28.tar (42GB large, needs to be uncompressed, so 84GB temporary storage needed)
